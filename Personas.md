Student 1 - 
I am a freshman BS computer science major.
My main goal is to lay out a rough schedule for my first two years especially while following the general requirements and prereq courses for CS.
I am very overwhelmed by all courses and don't know where to begin.

Student 2 - 
I am a sophomore BS computer science major. 
My main goal is to choose a concentration by the end of the year, but not fall behind in the CS path.
I am torn between AI and Data Science and want to get experience in both so I can choose without falling behind. 

Student 3 - 
I am a junior BA computer science major.
My main goal is to choose tech electives related to my interests (I need 5 300+ ones).
I don't know a lot about the courses or what their prereqs are.

Student 4 - 
I am a senior BS computer science major.
My main goal is to graduate with all my requirements for my core requirements and concentration.
I think I have completed everything but am not sure, and want to lay out my entire senior year plan / remaining courses.
