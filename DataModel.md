Data Model:
a degree plan (can be removed / added / viewed) is a collection of semesters, and a semester is a collection of courses, total credits??
Degree Plan has: title, collection of semesters that can be removed / added / viewed
Semesters have: title, collection of courses that can be removed / added / viewed, total credits??
Courses have: course code, course title, description, credits, prereq, type 
(types will be concentration, core, univ, COE, elective, etc. to differentiate between requirements for unique plans and concentration requirements)
Not sure how specific to get with univ and COE breadth requirements -> A, B, C, D, concentration -> restricted electives / core, univ -> cap / dle, etc.
Do we even need to specify the course (since there are limitless free elective options) or can we just do as the catalog does with ~insert elective here~
